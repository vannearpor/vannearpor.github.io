                    <h1>History of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency</h1>
                    <p>Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency, which is a digital assets designed to be worked as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to control its creation and management. It is decentralized without relying on central authorities. It was released to the public described as a "peer-to-peer network in a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust." Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto started working on Bitcoin concept in 2007; in 2009 the bitcoin network came into existence with the release of the first open source bitcoin client and issuance of the first bitcoins when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first block ever.</p>
                    <p>After much development, bitcoin started to gain legitimacy in public society as the use of the currency grows. In 2009, an exchange rate was established where USD $1 = 1,309 BTC. In 2013 a price surge began; the price of 1 BTC started off at $13 in January and reached an all-time high of $266 in April of that same year. Many believe that a recent economic crisis in the European Union caused people to look towards this currency which was beyond the control of governments.</p>
                    <p>It soon became clear that the main use of the currency in the early years appeared to be illicit activity, such as online gambling sites that use bitcoin. There was also the notorious Silk Road, an online marketplace which only accepts bitcoin that was used as a market for controlled substances and narcotics. The Silk Road was shut down by the government in the end of 2013.</p>
                    <p>Also during the end of 2013, bitcoin ATMs were starting to show up in Vancouver. These ATMs looked like an average ATM, but allowed the user to scan to confirm their identity to move bitcoin to and from their virtual wallet on their smartphone.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Fast Forward to Today</h1>
                    <p>2017 turned out to be a monumental year for Bitcoin and the world of cryptocurrency, making headlines in financial articles and news. The biggest investors in the world have publically shared their views on bitcoin, views conveying both hopeful optimism in it's technology from some and of great disdain from others.</p>
                    <p>It has become a common topic now that the cat is out of the box, the news of the price surges spread quickly throughout the world. There are a wide variety of exchanges in which you can buy bitcoin at almost every country. There are currently 1799 total bitcoin ATMs located around the globe, 74.1% of those located in North America. Bitcoin is accepted in many locations and online marketplaces, such as Overstock.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>So... It's Internet Money?</h1>
                    <p><i>Kind of.</i> In a simple sense, yes. But individual bitcoins aren't round tokens, as one would like to imagine. Bitcoin is really just a bunch of code, code that is stored in a record book. Bitcoin is a network that enables a new payments system and money that is completely digital. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered solely by the users, with no central authority or middlemen. So in a way, yes it is cash for the internet.</p>
                    <p>A common question people ask is, "Where does the value come from?"... Well, where does the value of a printed US Dollar come from? Where does the value of gold come from? How are things given value? Items and ideas gain value if people give it value; and with something as attractive as decentralized peer-to-peer payments with no strings attached, the value is there. Before this turns into economics lecture, I'll just leave that thought to the reader.<p>
