                        <p><b>My Personal Views on Cryptocurrency</b></p>
                        <p>This is just the beginning for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and I see a bright future. It has become too mainstream in today's news that it won't disappear anytime soon. This is only the beginning of something bigger if implemented correctly in the real-world. Many don't take the time to understand the technology behind it and are quick to become skepitcal. Will this succeed? Will this fail? Only time will tell.</p>
