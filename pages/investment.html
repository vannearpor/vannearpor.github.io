                    <br>
                    <p><b><i>Disclaimer: This is an educational piece and is not meant to serve as investment advice. I am not a financial advisor. Cryptocurrency is highly volatile and isn't for the faint of heart.</i></b></p>

                    <p>Bitcoin price and value is rising, one thing people immediately think of is <b>PROFIT!</b> So lets talk about money...</p>
                    <p>At the time of writing, The price is currently at around $7,800 USD = 1 BTC. Exactly a year ago it was $740 = 1 BTC. That is a return on investment of 1000%. Yes, a thousand percent return. People's 401k and stocks average a growth of about 7-10%, on a good year. This took the world by storm and everyone rushed in to gain in on an investment opportunity of a lifetime in bitcoin.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Owning Bitcoin</h1>
                    <p>Owning bitcoin for yourself is as easy as purchasing an item off of Amazon. There are exchanges that exist where you can deposit money into, and use that money to exchange for bitcoin depending on it's present price. There are many exchanges that exist around the world and from different countries; you're able to trade almost any currency for bitcoin whether it is USD, Euros, or Chinese Yuan.</p>

                    <h1>Other Cryptocurrencies</h1>
                    <p>Yes, there are other cryptocurrencies that were soon created after bitcoin. It's a whole world of hundreds of different currencies and companies using blockchain technology. The discovery of blockchain has opened the door to a new world of real-world implementation and uses. I won't delve too deep into the details of these other coins, however many of them do have value and potential.</p>
                    <p>Although these are very early projects in their infant stages, a lot of these other cryptocurrencies AKA "Alt Coins" have also been very profitable investments due to their project, goals, potential, and development team. For example, Ethereum is currently priced at $330 USD = 1 ETH; exactly 1 year ago, the price was $10 USD = 1 ETH. This is a 3,200% return on investment, a noticably larger return than Bitcoin.</p>

                        <h1>Quality "Alt Coins":</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Ethereum:</b></li>
                            <p>Perceived as the 2nd biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts. Smart Contracts are the bread and butter to this project, utilizing applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third party.</p>
                            <p>For example, imagine that you need a ride somewhere? What would you usually do, call Uber or Lyft right? The driver would use the rideshare app to pick you up from your location and drive you to your destination. You pay the driver and the driver makes money; however, Uber or Lyft takes a cut of the transactions because they facilitated it.</p>
                            <p>With smart contracts, this transaction becomes peer-to-peer! Imagine now with a programmed Ethereum application that works just like Uber or Lyft but after the task is accomplished, the user pays the driver in Ethereum in a peer-to-peer transaction without having to lose money to a middleman facilitating the transaction.</p>
                            <p>Smart contracts are applications that initiates the transaction ONLY when the programmed task is accomplished. See the potential here? Imagine Airbnb, Ebay, Music streaming from artist to listener, all done without having to pay a company to facilitate the goal.</p>
