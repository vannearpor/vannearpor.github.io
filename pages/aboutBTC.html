                    <h1>The Functionality</h1>
                    <p>Bitcoin is a digital currency which can be exchanged directly between two people without having to go through a bank or clearing house. In reality, it is just code on a network; this network is seen as some sort of a recordbook or ledger which records all transactions and accounts. These transactions are processed and verified by "miners". These miners are rewarded new bitcoins when verifying blocks, a package of transactions.</p>
                    <p>To own bitcoin, you have to create a digital wallet. Think of this as your own page in a recordbook, you have your own address in the network, just like how you have your own address on your neighborhood block. When you're sent bitcoin, the bitcoin is recorded in the recordbook and placed under your address - your digital wallet. This allows for peer-to-peer transactions; you can send a person bitcoin via their bitcoin address.</p>
                    <p>Here is a quick video further explaining how Bitcoin works:</p>

                    <h1>Can't It Get Hacked?</h1>
                    <p>The bitcoin blockchain is a decentralized exchange, meaning that it doesn't rely on a third party to conduct exchanges. The trade occurs directly between the users; the more users, the more decentralized it becomes. An example of a centralized exchange is a bank, it is a a third-party that is the <i>center</i> of the exchanges, this can be the focused of a hack and attacked. In order to hack the bitcoin blockchain, you'd have to hack and control atleast more than half, 51%, of the network. Now think about how difficult it would be to hack 51% of users. It's not <b>impossible</b>, but it's highly <b>improbable</b>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Why would I want Bitcoin?</h1>
                    <p>That's a great question; to start off, just look at what I've previously mentioned above. Peer-to-peer transactions takes away the centralized middleman, resulting in: low fees, transactions can be made anywhere around the world, a bank cannot freeze your account, and there are no pre-requisites or limits to your transactions.</p>
                    <p>In a more broader perspective, bitcoin gives financial power to the people and takes it away from the banks. How many times in the world news have you seen a country's economy go into panic because people were rushing to withdraw money from banks, and the banks had to temporary close? A few. This is scary, because this shows that the banks you put <b>all</b> your money in, can fail you.</p>
                    <p>The US is in massive debt, inflation is growing due to the ease of printing dollars. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency which has a capped maximum of 21 million bitcoins. This forced bitcoin value to increase due to simple supply and demand; while, as you may constantly be hearing, the US dollar value has been constantly decreasing. The US dollar is slowly starting to lose it's image as the "World's Currency".</p>
